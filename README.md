##### Note: this isn't the repo for the app mentioned on my linkedin or resume, this is a refreshed version of the Ring Relay I've built a year ago

## About

A chatting app that lets you see different stats about your texts and conversations such as freqency maps for words, average length of each message and more. I'd love for this app to use a dynamic unique design.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

Even if the most efficient back-end solution for this type of real-time app is to use websockets, Heroku removed their free tier so as a result I'm gonna use Vercel Serverless functions as the basis for the backend. Latency should not be noticable after the first messages (I know this from previous experience with SpiderEyes).

### Frontend

I feel like I'm already profficient with Vue because I used it for more than a year now so I'd really like to have the same level of familiarity with React cuz I enjoy using it just as much and it's also really popular.

### Databases

Since I already have 3 years of experience working with Mongo DB, I'll try out PlanetScale just for some novelty(this isn't a techinal driven decision cuz I'll be using this app with friends only anyway). I'll stick to Firebase Realtime DB for storing sessions and any other temporary data such as reset password tokens.

## Development Method

I'll use a Github project to track everything that needs doing and the progress on every task. Since I'm a big fan of Agile, I'll do the bulk development in sprits spanning a couple of days and use the same method for adding new features later on.
